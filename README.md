# FM Synthesizer controlled by hand movement
## Introduction
Implementation of a FM synthesizer, designed in **SUPERCOLLIDER**, controlled by tracking hand movements and visualization through geometric forms. 

### What is a FM Synthesizer?
It is a synthesizer that exploits **Frequency Modulation**, where the carrier oscillator is modulated in frequency with modulators. **FM Synthesis** can create both harmonic and inharmonic sounds, depending on the ratio between the carrier frequency and the modulator frequency. If the modulators frequencies are multiple integers of the carrier frequency the sound will be harmonic, instead if the ratio is a non-integer fraction the sound will be inharmonic.
